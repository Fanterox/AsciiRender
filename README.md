# AsciiRender!

### Prerequisites

You are going to need to have Haskel installed, this code has been made in Haskell version 8.0.2.

Get Haskell here: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/

If you're on windows, you're going to most likely want to have a linux subsystem installed, as to use the linux terminal.

## Instructions

### How to compile:

You will need to navigate in your prefered terminal to the folder where the rest of the folders are located, the one where you will find the Makefile

You will need to type in the terminal "make Render"


### Getting ready

For now, the code can only process .obj files

The .obj files will need to be located in the Models folder.

### Running the Render

In order to run the program you need to type "./Render" while in the main folder.

You will be prompted to input a filename, this will be the name of the file, withought its .obj extension

### How to stop the program

I have'nt made a more optimal way to stop the execution of the code, so for now if you want to stop the program you will need to press "ctrl + z". 

### Considerations

The code is really still in its early fases, so there are alot of things yet to be propperly implemented, ill try to continue working on it, but for the most part, it may not really get updated often.
So if you want to work on this code feel completely free to do so.
